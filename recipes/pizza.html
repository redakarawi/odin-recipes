        <p> A flat, open-faced baked pie of <em>Italian</em> origin, consisting of a thin layer of bread dough topped with spiced tomato sauce and cheese,
            often garnished with anchovies, sausage slices, mushrooms, etc.</p>   
        <h2>About the recipe:</h2>
        <p>This is a no-fuss dough recipe for beginners. You need just 6 basic ingredients, plus a little cornmeal for preparing the pan. (You can skip that if needed.)
            Most of the time is hands off as the dough rises. You might wonder… why waste the time when you can just buy frozen pizza dough?
            Frozen pizza dough is certainly convenient, but from-scratch crust has unbeatable flavor and texture that only comes from fresh dough.
            And you can use the dough for cheese breadsticks, too! Most of the time is hands off as the dough rises. You might wonder… why waste the time when you can just buy frozen pizza dough? Frozen pizza dough is certainly convenient,

        <h2>The recipe step by step:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Yeast</strong>: I use Platinum Yeast from Red Star. I have the best results when I use this instant yeast.
                The Platinum yeast is fantastic because its careful formula strengthens your dough and makes making working with yeast simple.
                You only need 1 standard packet of yeast (2 and 1/4 teaspoons) to get the job done
            </li>
            <li><strong>Water</strong>: I tested this pizza dough recipe with different amounts of water. 1 and 1/3 cups is the perfect amount
                Use warm water to cut down on rise time, about 100-110°F. Anything over 130ºF kills the yeast.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Flour</strong>: Use unbleached all-purpose white flour in this recipe. Bleaching the flour strips away some of the protein,
                which will affect how much water the flour absorbs. You can substitute bread flour for a chewier pizza crust.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Oil</strong>: A couple Tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil adds wonderful flavor to the dough.
                Don’t forget to brush the dough with olive oil before adding the toppings, which prevents the crust from tasting soggy.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Sugar</strong>: 1 Tablespoon of sugar increases the yeast’s activity and tenderizes the dough, especially when paired with a little olive oil.</li>
            <li><strong>Cornmeal</strong>: Cornmeal isn’t in the dough, but it’s used to dust the pizza pan. Cornmeal gives the pizza crust a little extra flavor and crisp</li>
        </ol>
